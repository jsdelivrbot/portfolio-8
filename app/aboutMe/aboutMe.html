				  	My name Stacy Areas.<br><br> 
				  	
				  	 
					I have always be a creative individual and after spending years as a photographer I felt the need to make a career change. When I stumbled upon web development, I never imagined how similar the creative process would be and almost immediately fell in love with the idea of building applications. I spent over a year building and learning everything I could and still feel I have so much more to learn. I don't think I will ever know everything there is to know about the tech world because it is forever changing, but I'm perfectly okay with that. Even though I no longer work as a photographer I still capture moments with the varies cameras I own and have a hobby of going to thrift stores and looking for any kind of cameras to keep adding to my collection.
