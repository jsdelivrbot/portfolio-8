				  	Hi, I'm Stacy Areas.<br><br> 
				  	I'm searching for the art of simplicity. I have an eye for photography and a heart for web development. I grew up in silicon valley and was bound to stumble into the tech world. I spent a little over a year in 2 immersive bootcamps and have built 6 projects that range from a VR game to health care app. I've gained the ability to learn, create, and finish anything I start. This is a passion that drives me to never stop building and learning because when it comes to tech you are always playing catch up to a continuously change world.</p>
